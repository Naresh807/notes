Introduction

. Elasticsearch makes use of several data structures
    . No single data structure serves all purpose
. Inverted indices are excellent for searching text
    . they don't perform well for many other data access pattern
. "Doc values" is another data structure used by apache Lucene        
    . Optimized for a different data access pattern(document -> terms)


. Essecntially an "univerted" inverted index
. Used for sorting, aggregations and scripting
. An additional data structure, not a replacement
. ElasticSearch automatically ueries the appropirate data structure

. Set the doc_values parameter to false to save disk space
        . Also slightly increases the indexing throughput
. Only disable doc values if you won't use aggregations, sorting or scripting
. Particularly useful for large indices: typically not worth it for small ones
