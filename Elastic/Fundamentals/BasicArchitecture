Cluster : It is the collection of related node
Node : It is the instance of elastic search that store data
   When node start up it will either join the existing cluster of create cluster with one node
Document : Each unit of data is called document. It is json document.
     In elastic document is store with some metadata
     Document json is stored into "Source" attibute in Elastic
 Document is organised in Indices, It is logical grouping
 Index : Collection of similiar document  

 Inspecting a Cluster

 Sharding and scalability
    Sharding : Divide indices into smaller pieces
               Each shard is apache lucene
        Purpose of Sharding
              Mainly to be able to store more documents
              To eaiser fit large indices onto nodes
              Improved performance 
                 Parallelization of queries increses the throughput of Index
 Replication
    Copy is referred as replica shards
    A shard that has been replicated, is called a primary shard
    A primary shard and replica shards is reffered to as replication grouping
