java.lang.class

Whenever a class is loaded by JVM along with that a Class<class> object is created

Primitive datatype(int/float/double etc..) are also represented as class object

Whenever a object is created first time then class get loaded in JVM and Class object get created

Three ways to get Class object

//forName
Class<?> clss1 = Class.forName("java.lang.String");

//ClassName.class
Class<?> clss2 = String.class;
Class<?> clss3 = int.class;

//obj.getClass
ReflectionDemo m = new ReflectionDemo();
Class<? extends ReflectionDemo> clss4 = m.getClass();
