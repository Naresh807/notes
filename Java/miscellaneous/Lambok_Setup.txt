Eclipse and Lombok

If you are using Eclipse instead of IntelliJ, there are additional installations steps you need.

To add Lombok support to Eclipse. Follow the steps below:



1. Download the Lombok JAR file installer from this link:

https://projectlombok.org/downloads/lombok.jar

2. Double-click the downloaded JAR file installer to start the installation process.

Note: Instead of double-click, you can run the installer from the command line. Move to the directory where you downloaded the file.

java -jar lombok.jar

3. Follow the steps in the installer.
