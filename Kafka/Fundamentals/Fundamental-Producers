Producers
 . Producers wirte data to topics(which is made of partition)
 . Producers automatically know to which broker and partition to write to
 . In case of Broker failures, Producers will automatically recover.

 Producers can choose to receive acknowledgement of data write
  . acks=0: Producer won't wait for acknowledgement (possible data loss)
  . acks=1: Producer will wait for leader acknowledgement (limited data loss)
  . acks=all: Leader + replicas acknowledgement (no data loss)

  Producers:Message keys
  . Producers can chosse to send a key with the message(string, number, etc)
  . If Key = null, data is sent round robin (broker 101 then 102 then 103)
  . If a key is sent, then all messages for thet key will always go the same partition
  . A key is basically sent if you need messager ordering for a specific field
