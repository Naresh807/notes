Zookeeper
 . Zookeeper manages brokers(keep a list of them)
 . Zookeeper helps in performing leader selection for partitions  
 . Zookeeper sends notifications to Kafka in case of changes(e.g. new topic, broker dies, broker comes up, delete topics, etc...)
 . Kafka can't work without Zookeeper
 . Zookeeper by design operates with an odd servers (3,5,7)
 . Zookeeper has a leader (hable writes) the rest of the servers are followers (hable reads)
 . (Zookeeper does NOT store consumer offsets with kafka > v0.10)
