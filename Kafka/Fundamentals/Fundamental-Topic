Partitions Count
  . Each partition can handle a throughput of a few MB/s (measure it for youe setup)
  . More partitions implies:
     . Better parallelism, better throughput
     . Ability to run more consumers in a group to scale
     . Ability to leverage more brokers if you have a large cluster
     . BUT more elections to perform for ZooKeeper
     . BUT more files opened on kafka
Guildlines:
  . Partitoins per topic
    .(Intuition) Small cluster (< 6 brokers) 2x # brokers
    .(Intuition) Big cluster (> 12 brokers): 1 x #of brokers
    . Adjust for number of consumers you need to run in parallel at peak throughput
    . Adjust for producer throughput

Replication factor
  . Should be atleast 2,usually 3, maximum 4

Cluster guildline
  . It is pretty much accepted that a broker should not hold more than 2000 to 4000 partitions (across all topics of that brokers)
  . Additonally, a Kafka cluster should have a maximum of 20,000 partitions across all brokers.
  . The reason is that in case of brokers going down, Zookeepers needs to perform a lot of leader elections.
